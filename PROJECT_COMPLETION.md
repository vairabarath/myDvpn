## âœ… Network Flow Implementation

### Direct Connection Flow
1. Client requests exit peer from local SuperNode âœ…
2. SuperNode queries BaseNode for target region âœ…
3. Remote SuperNode allocates exit peer âœ…
4. Exit peer receives SETUP_EXIT command âœ…
5. Client connects directly to exit peer âœ…

### Relay Connection Flow
1. Direct connection fails (NAT detection) âœ…
2. Local SuperNode sets up relay interface âœ…
3. Remote SuperNode configures exit peer âœ…
4. Client connects through SuperNode relay âœ…
5. Traffic flows: Client â†’ SN â†’ SN â†’ Exit âœ…
