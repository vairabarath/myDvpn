```

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Copy Project to All Computers
```bash
# Copy myDvpn to each of your 6 computers
scp -r myDvpn/ user@192.168.1.104:~/   # Computer 1
scp -r myDvpn/ user@192.168.1.103:~/   # Computer 2
scp -r myDvpn/ user@192.168.1.101:~/   # Computer 3
scp -r myDvpn/ user@192.168.1.46:~/    # Computer 4
scp -r myDvpn/ user@192.168.1.40:~/    # Computer 5
scp -r myDvpn/ user@192.168.1.41:~/    # Computer 6
```

### Step 2: Deploy Each Computer
```bash
# Run on each computer:
cd myDvpn
./scripts/setup-computer.sh

# Then select:
# Computer 1 (192.168.1.104) → Select 1 (BaseNode India)
# Computer 2 (192.168.1.103) → Select 2 (BaseNode US)
# Computer 3 (192.168.1.101) → Select 3 (SuperNode India)
# Computer 4 (192.168.1.46)  → Select 4 (SuperNode US)
# Computer 5 (192.168.1.40)  → Select 5 (Client India)
# Computer 6 (192.168.1.41)  → Select 6 (Client US)
```

### Step 3: Verify and Test
```bash
# Run pre-flight checks
./scripts/pre-deployment-check.sh

# Run comprehensive tests
./scripts/test-lan-deployment.sh
```

## 🧪 Key Test Scenarios

### 1. **Infrastructure Test**
```bash
# Check all services are running
curl http://192.168.1.104:8080/metrics  # BaseNode India
curl http://192.168.1.103:8080/metrics  # BaseNode US
curl http://192.168.1.101:8080/metrics  # SuperNode India  
curl http://192.168.1.46:8080/metrics   # SuperNode US
```

### 2. **Role Switching Magic** (Computer 6)
```bash
# On Computer 6 (192.168.1.41)
./test-client-us.sh

# Interactive session:
myDvpn> status                    # Mode: client
myDvpn> toggle-exit on            # Switch to exit provider
myDvpn> status                    # Mode: exit
myDvpn> clients                   # Show connected clients
```

### 3. **Cross-Region VPN** (Computer 5 → Computer 6)
```bash
# On Computer 5 (192.168.1.40)
./test-client-india.sh

# Connect to US exit:
myDvpn> connect us                # Routes to Computer 6
myDvpn> status                    # Connected to US exit

# Test internet through VPN:
curl ifconfig.me                 # Should show Computer 6's public IP
ping 8.8.8.8                     # Through VPN tunnel
traceroute 8.8.8.8               # See route via Computer 6
```

### 4. **WireGuard Verification**
```bash
# On all computers, check WireGuard:
sudo wg show                      # Active connections
ip addr show | grep wg-           # WireGuard interfaces

# Traffic monitoring:
sudo tcpdump -i wg-client-*       # Monitor tunnel traffic
sudo nethogs wg-*                 # Monitor bandwidth usage
```

### 5. **Hybrid Mode** (Revolutionary!)
```bash
# On Computer 5 (192.168.1.40):
myDvpn> toggle-exit on            # Enable exit mode
myDvpn> connect us                # Connect to US (Computer 6)
myDvpn> status                    # Mode: hybrid

# Now Computer 5 is:
# • Providing VPN services to others
# • Using VPN services from Computer 6
# • True peer-to-peer VPN mesh!
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Successful Deployment Shows:
- ✅ All 6 services running on your specific IPs
- ✅ Cross-region communication (India ↔ US)
- ✅ WireGuard tunnels with real encryption
- ✅ Role switching working in real-time
- ✅ Internet traffic routing through exit peers
- ✅ Hybrid mode enabling true P2P VPN

### Performance Metrics:
- Connection time: < 5 seconds
- Role switch time: < 2 seconds  
- VPN tunnel latency: Local LAN latency + minimal overhead
- Throughput: Limited by your LAN speed and CPU

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Your Network

### Check Connectivity:
```bash
# Test from any computer to others:
ping 192.168.1.104    # BaseNode India
ping 192.168.1.103    # BaseNode US
ping 192.168.1.101    # SuperNode India
ping 192.168.1.46     # SuperNode US
ping 192.168.1.40     # Client India
ping 192.168.1.41     # Client US
```

### Check Services:
```bash
# On each computer:
sudo systemctl status mydvpn-*
sudo journalctl -u mydvpn-* -f
```

### Check Firewalls:
```bash
# Ensure these ports are open:
sudo ufw allow 50051/tcp    # BaseNode
sudo ufw allow 50052/tcp    # SuperNode  
sudo ufw allow 51820:51825/udp  # WireGuard
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp     # Metrics
```

## 🎯 What This Proves

Your 6-computer test will demonstrate:

1. **Real Decentralized VPN**: No central servers needed
2. **Dynamic Contribution**: Users instantly become providers
3. **Cross-Region Routing**: Encrypted tunnels between regions
4. **Production Readiness**: Complete monitoring and management
5. **Revolutionary UX**: Simple commands for complex networking

### Traditional VPN vs Your myDvpn:
```
Traditional:  Users → Pay → Central VPN Company → Internet
Your myDvpn:  User A ↔ User B ↔ User C (help each other)
```
